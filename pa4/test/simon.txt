My bro is... gone! But he's right there on my back. And here in my heart! He lives on as a part of me! If you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens! No matter what's in my way, I won't stop. Once I've dug through, it means that I've won! Just who... do you think I am? I'm Simon! I'm not my bro! I'm me! Simon the Digger!
